Password Generator

A program that generates a random password based on user input.

Tools and Technologies Used:

    - Programming Language: Python 3
    - Development Environment: Any Python IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

Project Structure:

    - main.py: The main script that initiates the password generation process and manages user input.
    - README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

Features:

    - Generates passwords of user-defined length between 8 and 30 characters.
    - Optionally includes Scandinavian letters (Å, Ä, Ö).
    - Customizable with a variety of characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Objectives:
Through this project, I aim to strengthen the following programming skills:

    - Using basic Python constructs: variables, loops, conditional statements.
    - Utilizing functions and modules.
    - Basics of user input handling.
    - Generating random data and manipulating strings.

Notes:

    - This project is a personal learning tool and is not intended to be shared or used by others.
